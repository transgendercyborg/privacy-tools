## So you want to disappear
If you're like me, and you don't trust websites with your information at all in any way, you can use a combination of the above tools, as well as the following to be someone else online.
| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [TAILS OS](https://tails.boum.org/) | endorsed and used by [NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden](https://www.wired.com/2014/04/tails/). |
| [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) | comes pre-packaged in the above OS, but can be installed on its own. |
| [FakeNameGenerator](fakenamegenerator.com/) | Generates fake identities including a functioning temporary email address in order to remain anonymous online. |
| [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) | AI generates images of human faces, may take a few tries to get anything passable. |
