## Ease of use addons
| Addon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [12ft.io](https://12ft.io/) | Hops over paywalls to news articles. |
| [Just The Recipe](https://www.justtherecipe.com/) | Removes ads, e-mail newsletters and tragic backstories from recipe pages. |
| [UnPayWall](https://unpaywall.org/) | Harvests fulltext scholarly articles from over 50,000 legal open-access repositories and journals. While looking at an article behind a paywall, a green tab may appear to view the article for free! This does not rely on legally dubious tools like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) or [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.st/) |
| [Bypass Paywall Clean](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean) | Legally dubious way of bypassing paywalls on news sites |
| [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube) | Adds extra features to YouTube including keyboard shortcuts, loop mode, custom scripts, and more |
| [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) | Crowdsourced data allows the tool to skip sponsored segments on YouTube videos. Users submit when a sponsor happens, and the extension automatically skips sponsors it knows about. |
