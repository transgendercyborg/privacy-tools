## Privacy addons
| Addon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AdNauseam](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adnauseam/) | To throw ad networks off your trail AdNauseam “clicks” blocked and hidden ads, polluting your data profile and injecting noise into the economic system that drives online surveillance.  |
| [ClearURLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/) | Removes tracking elements from URLs |
| [Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/sk/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/) | When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Keep the ones you trust (forever/until restart) while deleting the rest.  |
| [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/sk/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/) | Prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. |
| [Disconnect for Facebook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-disconnect-ii/?src=collection) | Firewall to disconnect third-party websites from accessing to your Facebook |
| [Don't track me Google](https://addons.mozilla.org/sk/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/) | Removes Google's tracking link conversion. |
| [DuckDuckGo](https://addons.mozilla.org/sk/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/) | DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials comes packed with best-in-class privacy essentials and makes browsing in Firefox even faster. |
| [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook) | Like the above, keeps Facebook in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Facebook and deletes the cookies that Facebook uses to track you on other websites. May break some Facebook features on other sites. |
| [ForgetMeNot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/forget_me_not/) | Make the browser forget website data (like cookies, local storage, etc.), except for the data you want to keep by adding domains to a whitelist, graylist, blacklist, or redlist. |
| [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) | Rewrites web requests to use https by default, and warns when a site is only available in unencrypted http |
| [I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/sk/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/) | Automatically hides cookie pop-ups, mostly accepting necessary cookies, but sometimes accepts all. Best in combination with Cookie AutoDelete or ForgetMeNot. |
| [JustDeleteMe](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/just-delete-me/) | adds a traffic light system to your search bar which indicates how difficult it is to delete an account for that site. Clicking on the icon takes you to the deletion page for that site. |
| [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) | Allows you to login to multiple accounts for the same webpage, marking open tabs with a relevant label.
| [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) | Learns to block invisible trackers based on their behaviours |
| [Privacy Possum](https://github.com/cowlicks/privacypossum) | Makes tracking you less profitable by costing tracking companies more money than they make from you |
| [TrackMeNot](https://trackmenot.io/) | Runs a low-priority background process that periodically issues randomized search-queries to popular search engines hiding your actual searches in a cloud of 'ghost' searches. Can be configured, words like "bomb" and "porn" are blocked by default to prevent incriminating searches on your behalf. |
| [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) | Adblock and Adblock plus sell browsing data. Use this one. |
| [WhatCampaign](https://home.oniprojekt.ninja/) | Send false data to Google Analytics by blocking ads and sending fake clicks to them. Wastes advertisers money. |
