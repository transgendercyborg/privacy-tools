| [TrackMeNot](https://trackmenot.io/) | Runs a low-priority background process that periodically issues randomized search-queries to popular search engines hiding your actual searches in a cloud of 'ghost' searches. Can be configured, words like "bomb" and "porn" are blocked by default to prevent incriminating searches on your behalf. |
