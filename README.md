# The Obvious
Chrome is bad, please stop using Chrome and Chromium based browsers like Ecosia and Microsoft Edge! 
Chromium browsers track what websites you visit and your activity there, and sell this data to tracking & advertising companies so that they can show you more ads.
instead consider using: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new) or [Opera](https://www.opera.com/). 
To some extent, Windows and iOS are also doing this, consider moving to an appropriate [Linux Distro](https://distrotest.net/) for your setup.

# Privacy addons
| Addon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) | Learns to block invisible trackers based on their behaviours |
| [Privacy Possum](https://github.com/cowlicks/privacypossum) | Makes tracking you less profitable by costing tracking companies more money than they make from you |
| [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) | Rewrites web requests to use https by default, and warns when a site is only available in unencrypted http |
| [TrackMeNot](https://trackmenot.io/) | Runs a low-priority background process that periodically issues randomized search-queries to popular search engines hiding your actual searches in a cloud of 'ghost' searches. Can be configured, words like "bomb" and "porn" are blocked by default to prevent incriminating searches on your behalf. |
| [WhatCampaign](https://home.oniprojekt.ninja/) | Send false data to Google Analytics by blocking ads and sending fake clicks to them. Wastes advertisers money. |
| [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) | Allows you to login to multiple accounts for the same webpage, marking open tabs with a relevant label.
| [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook) | Like the above, keeps Facebook in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Facebook and deletes the cookies that Facebook uses to track you on other websites. May break some Facebook features on other sites. |
| [JustDeleteMe](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/just-delete-me/) | adds a traffic light system to your search bar which indicates how difficult it is to delete an account for that site. Clicking on the icon takes you to the deletion page for that site. |
