## First things first
Chrome is bad, please stop using Chrome and Chromium based browsers like Ecosia and Microsoft Edge! 
Chromium browsers track what websites you visit and your activity there, and sell this data to tracking & advertising companies so that they can show you more ads.
instead consider using: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new) or [Opera](https://www.opera.com/). 
To some extent, Windows and iOS are also doing this, consider moving to an appropriate [Linux Distro](https://distrotest.net/) for your setup.
